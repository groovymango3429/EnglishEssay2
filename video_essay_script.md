## Opening (30 seconds)

When I started this course, I thought I knew what "good writing" meant—clean sentences, proper grammar, maybe some fancy vocabulary thrown in. But here's what I've actually learned: I'm becoming a writer who understands that rhetoric isn't about decoration; it's about making deliberate choices that shape how people think. That's my thesis today—**WHAT** I've learned is that effective communication requires intentional design; **HOW** I discovered this through analyzing real-world rhetoric and applying feedback loops to my own work; and **SO WHAT**—this changes everything about how I'll approach not just writing, but any form of persuasion in my future.

## Body Part 1: The "What" - What I've Learned (90 seconds)

The rhetorical analysis assignment was a turning point. Before this, I'd read arguments and either agreed or disagreed—that was the extent of my analysis. But when I had to break down how someone constructs an argument, identifying their audience, their appeals, their strategic choices, I realized I'd been consuming media like a passive sponge my entire life.

I learned to ask different questions: "Why did they open with that story?" "Who is this trying to reach, and who is it excluding?" "What values are they assuming their audience holds?" This isn't just about writing essays—it's about being a conscious consumer of information in a world that's constantly trying to persuade me of something.

The most uncomfortable realization? I discovered I had been using emotional manipulation in my own arguments without even knowing it. When I revised my inquiry dialogue based on feedback, I caught myself making claims I couldn't support, just because they sounded convincing. That's a habit I want to avoid—not because it's "bad writing," but because it's intellectually dishonest.

## Body Part 2: The "How" - My Learning Process (90 seconds)

[Visual: Show revision history or feedback comments]

The real learning happened in the revision cycles. I used to treat first drafts as final drafts with light editing. This course forced me to actually revise—not just proofread, but rethink. The feedback I received on my inquiry dialogue made me realize I was writing to fill space, not to explore ideas.

Here's a specific example: In my inquiry dialogue, I originally wrote a question that I already knew the answer to. The feedback pointed out that I wasn't actually inquiring—I was just performing inquiry. 

So I went back and asked a question I genuinely didn't know the answer to: "How do visual elements in digital media shape arguments in ways that text alone cannot?"

This shift was uncomfortable. Real inquiry means admitting uncertainty. But that's also when I started to notice things I'd never seen before. I began observing how Instagram posts use image sequencing to build arguments, how memes compress complex political rhetoric into shareable formats. I didn't find complete answers, but I developed better questions, and I think that might be more valuable.

The habit I've picked up is this: pause before making a claim and ask, "Can I actually support this, or does it just feel true?" That's been surprisingly hard to maintain, but I catch myself more often now.

## Body Part 3: The "So What" - Future Application (90 seconds)

So why does any of this matter beyond getting a grade in this class? 

First, I can't scroll through social media the same way anymore. I automatically start identifying rhetorical strategies—which is both enlightening and exhausting. I've started noticing when articles use loaded language, when advertisements appeal to fear, when politicians dodge questions. This awareness is a tool I'll use in every future context where someone is trying to convince me of something.

Second, the "What, How, So What" structure isn't just for essays. It's a thinking tool. When I'm preparing for a job interview, I can use it: What did I accomplish? How did I do it? So what—why does it matter to you? When I'm in a disagreement with someone, I can use it to clarify my own thinking before I respond.

Third, I've realized I still don't know how to effectively use visual rhetoric. I can analyze it, but creating it is different. That's something I want to learn on my own—maybe through design courses, maybe through experimentation. The question from my inquiry dialogue about visual elements isn't fully answered, and I'm planning to keep exploring it by analyzing video essays (like this one) and practicing with different media.

## Conclusion (30 seconds)

[Visual: Return to talking head, then closing text]

If I'm being honest—and that's what this reflection is supposed to be—the biggest lesson isn't about rhetoric or writing techniques. It's about intellectual honesty. I learned to catch myself when I'm performing understanding instead of actually understanding. I learned to revise my thinking, not just my sentences. And I learned that inquiry is uncomfortable because real questions don't have easy answers.

These aren't just writing lessons. They're thinking lessons. And that's what I'm taking forward.
